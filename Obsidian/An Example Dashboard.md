# The First heading
body text after this content is not columnated so we can type for as much as we want and continue typing and it won't be broken into separate columns. see this very long block of text is still contained within a single column and not multiple!

- **The Major Left column (first item in list)**
	- ## A heading for the Major Left Column (second level of list)
	- stuff for wide column (like dashboard) a very long listed item name that goes on for a long long time
		- ### heading for small column
			- List item 1
				- sublist items
				- dataview inline queries
			- list item 2
		- ### heading for small column (\#2)
			- list items
			- dataview inline queries
		- ### heading for small column (\#2)
			- list items
			- dataview inline queries
	- ## This is a new section for the major left column (second level of list)
	- Items within this section should now work as expected. this is body text for this section
		- ### and this is a list
			- see this new list item
			- and another here
		- plus a new column here
			- up to three columns
			- and we get more items in the list
			- as many as we want
		- ### this is the third column
			- here we see the last list
		- Or is it?
			- more then three lists will wrap around
			- and we can have all the lists
	- This text will span across the entire dashboard if we type long enough. se here we go, and some more typing, bleh blah blue blegh. Anything at this list level (2) will span the entire Major column
- &nbsp; %% blank space to align the first headings of both Major columns %%
	- ## A heading for the Major Right Column
	- %% The level above can be left blank if no heading is desired%% Otherwise you can include body text for the Major right column, this was used as body text, maybe I don't need separate body and heading 
	- stuff for narrow column (like normal) and another long listed name to see how far this goes
	- Level 2 of the list acts as body text or can be used for headers
	- # Heading 1
	- ## Heading 2
	- ### Heading 3
	- #### Heading 4
	- ##### Heading 5
	- ###### Heading 6
	- some more body text
	- ## Like this new header
		- ### heading for small column
			- list items
			- dataview inline queries
		- ### a list of headings
			- # Heading 1
			- ## Heading 2
				- with some sub items
			- ### Heading 3
			- #### Heading 4
				- to see how they look
			- ##### Heading 5
				- like this one for instance
			- ###### Heading 6
			- some more body text

### Another heading
the hr and everything after are just plain body text. if we wanted to, we could create another list and essentially have a second dashboard down below.
